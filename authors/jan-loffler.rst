Hi, I joined Zalando in June 2014 and have a passion for cloud infrastructures and software development for web related products in genereal.

Here at Zalando I'm together with my teams responsible for the Zalando Platform including datacenters, network, databases, continuous delivery, deployment tooling, monitoring products, security, identity and access management solutions and much more.

I enjoy especially the team spirit here at Zalando and the way we are always finding great solutions and do not stop thinking big!
