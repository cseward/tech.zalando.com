.. author_title: Product Manager - Shop Team

Hello everyone! My name is Mikhail and I was born in Russia. I have been living in Germany for more than 10 years and have worked as a Product Manager for Zalando's Shop Team since September 2011. I really enjoy my job here because of the exciting projects and international atmosphere. We are many nations with one main goal: To deliver worldâ€™s best fashion online experience to our customers. For me this means if I see our customers happy, I can sleep peacefully ;-)
