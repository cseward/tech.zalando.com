.. author_title: Head of Logistics Software

I joined Zalando in the beginning of 2010. Since then I had several roles and projects. Everything started with my personal favorite project of all time. The name was booster and we improved our web shop speed by the factor 40 in 2 weeks. Afterwards I was a team lead of our backend team and in the beginning of 2012 I started our logistics department where we are creating the software for our own warehouses.
