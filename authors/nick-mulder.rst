Hey! I am a Product Management Trainee that joined Zalando Technology in October 2014 after graduating with a Masters
in Information Management. In the previous years I dabbled in technology projects, ranging from building websites
to fitness apps while living in a handful of different countries. At Zalando I hope to learn the tricks of the trade
to one day become a successful leader that helps keep Zalando at the forefront of technology.
