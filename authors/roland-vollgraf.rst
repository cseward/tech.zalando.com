Hi, I'm Roland. I'm Data Science Expert at Zalando with a strong background in Machine Learning 
and Statistical Signal Processing. Coming from a quantitative finance company, I joined Zalando in 
the beginning of 2013. Inside the Data Department I lead a R&D team of a handfull of analysts. We 
started off focusing on optimizations for warhouse logistics and operations research. Meanwhile we have
shifted our focus towards hot topics in the areas statistical learning, image processing and computer vision.
