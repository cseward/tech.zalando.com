Hi, I’m Product Manager in our Shop Frontend Team since 2011.
I started one year ago as Interaction Designer and developed my self into the direction of a Product Manager.
Working in this team is really exciting because web technologies are changing quite fast and also customer expectations and needs are growing over time.
Since September 2014 I’m Product Owner for our Catalogue Pages as well as Header & Footer.
In my job I’m able to combine my expertise as PM, my UX skills as well as my HTML/CSS and basic JS skills in order to create a really good product.
