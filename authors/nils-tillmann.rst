.. author_title: Team Lead - QA

Hello there! I started working at Zalando as a QA Engineer in the beginning of last year. It has been a blast so far. Ensuring a great product quality before releasing new features to production environment is one of the main objectives of my daily business - and also to keep the quality great. This involves a lot of interaction with product owners and feature developers, questioning and challenging of requirements, as well as writing a whole bunch of tests and the development of test tools. Best part of the job is, that I am actually part of a team where every single one of us is constantly striving to improve the product and never seems to be satisfied with the accomplished, yet - a bit better is always possible!
