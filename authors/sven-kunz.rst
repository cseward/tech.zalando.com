Hi, Iâ€™m Sven and I am a Frontend Developer addicted to HTML5 and CSS3. I had the opportunity to work on several projects at Zalando like the Shop-Page itself, the TechBlog and many more. I really love working with these technologies and it is always challenging to push the envelope! I am most interested in creating clean markup and prefer to implement features using only CSS without using JavaScript whenever possible.
