Hi! I've joined Zalando in March, 2014. In the past year I've been working on the Zalando system landscape which involved various topics like improving and enhancing the Puppet code, CDN related stuff. Right now I'm working in the Cloud infrastructure team, which is working on enabling the development teams in order to make shipping code more enjoyable.
