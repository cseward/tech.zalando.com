Hi, I started working at Zalando in January 2014. My passion is Software Quality and I have lived this passion over the past
16 years in various positions and projects. As the Head of Technologies Quality Assurance Department I feel responsible
for the quality of our eCommerce platform. What I like most about Zalando is that it never get boring with all the projects
in all the different domains, from our online shop over the backend services to our logistics software.
