.. author_title: Product Management - Support

Hello, my name is Martin and I work for the Zalando Lounge since 2013. As Product Management Support I maintain tooling and frontend products once they are released. My task contains mainly tracking down all little bugs and flaws that still exist and eable stakeholders and users to work seamlessly on those products. Apart from that, I support Product Managers witch minor change requests for the product. Last but not least, I am responsible for keeping all the Content Pages up-to-date. When not at work, I live my passion for movies and music.
