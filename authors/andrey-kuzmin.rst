Hi! My name is Andrey and I joined Zalando in 2014.

During my career I have been struggling between back-end and front-end worlds,
doing full cycle web development myself. But personally I prefer front-end engineering,
because of so many new things emerging in this area.

I try to challenge myself with every project I take, to learn something new and improve my productivity.
