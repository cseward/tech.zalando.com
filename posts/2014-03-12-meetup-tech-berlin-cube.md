On February 27th, Zalando had the opportunity to participate in Berlin's
bi-monthly Tech MeetUp event in the Mobilesuite coworking space. Along with six
other great startups, we presented the Cube for the first time in public.

<!-- TEASER_END -->
The format of this event is simple but effective: 5 minutes presentation and
5 minutes QA for each company participating. The only rule being that no one
can talk or ask about the business model behind it; it is about the technology,
not about the money.

Events like this offer a great space for companies to present their ideas and
to start communities around them. This is the main reason why Zalando is so
happy to participate. Last year we licensed some of our tools with the Apache
License and [hosted them on github](https://github.com/zalando), hoping that other people would benefit from
them, and also contribute. Presenting the Cube App to the tech community of
Berlin was a great opportunity that attracted users and developers.

"How come is so snappy" or "Can I have a hierarchical tree view also?" were
some of the questions given in the QA section. Overall people liked the Cube
and some were interested to try it out in their own companies. Success!

The other startups also presented really cool apps and ideas:

[Uberall](https://uberall.com) is helping stores to have an online presence and
be easily found by people.

[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) hosts continuous integration services for
the open source community.

[Mbrace](http://www.getmbrace.com/) is helping people to connect, by interesting
'challenges' and smart people-match algorithms.

[The Football App](http://www.thefootballapp.com/) showed us the advantages of
developing with Golang.

[AppLift](http://www.applift.com/) is an interesting marketing platform for mobile games, and

[Sensorberg](http://www.sensorberg.com/) as an iBeacon management platform full of nice ideas.
