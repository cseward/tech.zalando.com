By utilizing the powerful Facebook [Open Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/), for the first time in
the history of Zalando, we are now able to offer our socially active customers
a highly improved social shopping experience. Once connected to Facebook, our
customers are now able to share their purchases and favourites with less
effort, and make use of beautifully optimized timeline stories. This gives our
customers the chance to enjoy the fun side of social shopping as opposed to
the less sophisticated Facebook like plugin.

And here is how it works from a
customer’s view, at the moment for French customers only:

## 1. Activate “Social Shopping”
[![Zalando_MyAccount](/files/2013/09/MyAccount_Permission2.jpg)](/files/2013/09/MyAccount_Permission2.jpg) Connecting with your Facbook
account helps you to reduce disturbing Facebook login requests in the future.
You can either activate “Social Shooping” in your Zalando account settings
(see screen 1), or after completing a purchase.

## 2. Favour and buy your products on Zalando just as you love it

screen 2) and purchased products will be shared effortlessly to your friend’s
newstickers on Facebook.

## 3. Beautifully optimized stories in your friend’s newsticker
[![FB sharing](/files/2013/09/FB-sharing-1024x518.jpg)](/files/2013/09/FB-sharing.jpg) There it is, a beautifully
optimized story which actually respresents the action you triggered in the
Zalando Shop. By default, social shopping stories will be posted to your
friend’s newsticker (Screen 3 - right). If you want to display them in your
timeline, just add the setting “allow on timeline” to the story.

## Privacy
We took care that items you might not want to share with your friends are
taken out of this service. Those items, e.g. underwear or pyjamas, won’t be
shared with Facebook! Whenever you don’t feel like sharing a specific product,
you can also always edit your stories in Facebook or even delete them within
your activity log. If you ever want to get back to the normal shopping
experience, you can always do so by deactivating the social shopping feature
inside your customer account (see Screen 1).

We are very excited about the
upcoming feedback of our French customers about this whole new feature. For
us, this is just the beginning of tapping into the possibilities of
integrating more deeply with a social API, and combining them with the
e-commerce sphere. We hope to gather many learnings from the French market,
which can be used to further develop the service for our customers in the
future.
