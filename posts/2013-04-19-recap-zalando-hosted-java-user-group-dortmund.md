Only 3 days ago, on April 16,
Zalando provided the public with a look of what's under the hood at Zalando's
backend development. Hosted at Zalando Technology in the prominent football
city of Dortmund, Jan Mußler traveled all the way from Berlin to explain
Zalando's database philosophy to the local Java gurus, the 
[Java User Group Dortmund](http://www.jugdo.de/). The topic of his talk: Weaving Stored
Procedures into Java at Zalando. Today's blogpost is a recap of the event.

Some visitors already arrived at Zalando Technology in Dortmund half an hour
before the event was scheduled to begin to see our office and get a feel for
our culture. We had casual and interesting chats with our visitors, anxiously
anticipating the talk. The hour-long talk began with a brief introduction
about Zalando Technology, focusing on the what the Dortmund office does. Then,
Jan Mußler discussed the backend implementation in great detail. It should
come to no surprise that Zalando counts on open source products. We rely on a
PostgresSQL database to persist our data. During the talk, chilled drinks were
served in what was a relaxed atmosphere.

Our visitors asked Jan lots of
specific questions on the subject of his talk. After the hour was over, our
visitors, their interest piqued, stayed on to pepper Jan with further
questions about overall development process at Zalando Technology.

Many of us left the office late because the mood and feedback to the talk were
positive. The evening ultimately ended with a highly emotional series of
foosball matches -- ending positive for some, negative (at least temporarily)
for others. ;)

Unfortunately, we couldn't accommodate everyone to take part in Jan Mußler's
talk and the ensuing conversations. The limited number of seats filled up
within a few hours of the announcement. Therefore, if you missed the
