The PGConf "marathon" 2013 is over, two weeks filled with traveling are over. 
First step Dublin, Ireland followed up by the town of Oberhausen, Germany. We followed
presentations, exchanged experiences and enjoyed the social events and now we
are back in Berlin with lots of positive impressions from the growing
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) community.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

At the [European conference](http://2013.pgconf.eu) in Dublin we used the lightning talks to
present our PostgreSQL monitoring setup with
[pg_view](http://github.com/zalando/pg_view) and
[PGObserver](http://zalando.github.io/PGObserver) and to fuel the interest
into Valentine’s talk the next day about Elephants in Fashion. Valentine dived
into our PostgreSQL experience, the setup and the processes surrounding our
database development and infrastructure. This promotion payed off, we got a
lot of attendees to our talk and quite a few questions were raised and hallway
discussions triggered.


On other frontiers it was interesting to learn about
successful migrations to PostgreSQL and deployments on powerful machines
including large SSD drives. Talks about upcoming PostgreSQL features and
development plans shed some insight into what to expect in the “near” future
or years ahead. Features strengthening PostgreSQL in the world of business
intelligence seem promising, including the min/max indexes. Current work on
logical replication, which may finally lead to rolling major version upgrades,
is of particular interest in our always available world.

Back from Ireland just one week later we headed to the [German-speaking PostgreSQL
conference](http://2013.pgconf.de) to get to know the German user base and
give our second talk, this time in German with a slight variation in what was
covered, using some of the feedback we got the week before. It was a nice
surprise to see some familiar faces and continue the exchange on topics
initiated the week before. Following different talks including ones from
German government institutions it seems PostgreSQL is on the right path to
replace some of the expensive proprietary database setups, the overall
impression is that PostgreSQL can deliver and provides a lot of flexibility.

Before we share our slides with you, we want to thank all those involved in
organizing both the PGConf Europe and its German counterpart for their hard
work, and to #blameMagnus for what did not work.
