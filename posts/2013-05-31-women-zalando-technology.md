With the Technology team growing as fast as it does, unfortunately
it is too easy to lose track of new colleagues that join us every month. But
be it Database Engineers, Product Managers, Quality Assurance Managers, or
Developers, there is one group that shares a common denominator: they’re
female. What all of us also have in common is a deep love for all things
science and technology. So what could be more obvious than giving this group
the opportunity to connect, get to know each other, and share their
experiences?

This is where the Technology Ladies Evening was born. After the first two very
succesful evenings, we etablished the event at loose intervals (usually every
six to eight weeks) for after-work drinks and to give a platform to form
connections between teams and job profiles. We of course also secretly hope to
encourage more women to join our ranks – already at a whopping 12 percent (not
bad for a tech department, eh?), there’s always room for more. Personally, I
love the diversity of backgrounds and interests – I recently learned about
all-female hackathons and that one can study such a thing as
technomathematics!
