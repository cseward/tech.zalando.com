After a challenging development phase over the past weeks,
our Shop Channel App Team has published the Zalando Android App v1.0 on the
Google Play Store. You can find it
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.zalando.mobile) or
just download it to your Android phone. We are very proud of our first mobile
application, which was developed in-house and we hope our customers will enjoy
the experience on our company's most recent shopping platform. In a follow-up
blogpost, we will give you more insights on [how we managed to get the app up
and running](http://tech.zalando.com/zalando-android-app-how-we-managed-it-in-
only-eleven-weeks/) in only eleven development weeks. So stay tuned to hear
from us pretty soon.
