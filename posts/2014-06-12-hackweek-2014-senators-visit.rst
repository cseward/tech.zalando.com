The Hack Week welcomed a high-ranking visitor today. Berlin's Senator for Economics, Technology and Research, Ms. Cornelia Yzer, took a glimpse at Hack Week. She took a tour through our Technology offices and attended one of our usability tests in the Zalando User Lab. After a meeting with Rubin, Member of the Management Board, she stated: “Zalando Hack Week is a good example for how much creative energy slumbers in young Berlin-based companies. Zalando does not only talk about innovation, but lives up to it very proactively.”
