A late, yet dry and relatively hot summer
with a number of opportunities to celebrate Zalando's 5th birthday has finally
come to an end. Before temperatures dropped for good here in Berlin, we took
one of the last warm days to throw a final and memorable party at our
Schuckert Höfe offices, a historical factory complex built in the late 19th
century.

Together with our colleagues of Zalando Lounge and zVentures, we had
a delicious BBQ, fresh cocktails, great electronic music and a lot of fun
until midnight. Various geek toys were available and allowed us to compete
against each other - including table soccer, various video games and a really
cool vintage Carrera slot car racing track, not to mention the fully-fledged
dance floor with lights and fog machine.

For Zalando Technology, however, the evening was bittersweet as it was also a farewell from Schuckert Höfe. In less
than 12 months, our team has outgrown most offices thus far occupied at
various locations across Berlin. Very typical for a young company progressing
at such rapid pace and often running into scalability issues, it was about
time to regroup and consolidate. Our department found a new, cool and much
bigger home near Alexanderplatz, which should last for a while.

To that end, despite suffering major hangover casualties from the party, the next day was
dedicated to packing and labeling boxes before the big move in accordance to
the (unofficial) Zalando credo of "_Work hard, play harder_". Following the
handover of a clean swept, abandoned office to other Zalando departments, we
have finally relocated and settled into our wonderful new premises. More
details to follow soon!
